# Course loading is structured differently from step file loading. In
# step files, SongItem is instantiated,creates an instance of a
# specific file class, loads it, and pulls the information it needs
# from it. In Courses, CourseFile is just function that returns an
# object of the appropriate type, which inherits from Course.

# I'm not sure which approach is better.
