! .step support removed.
! All your records will be deleted upon running this.

* Fix DWI parsing bugs and typos introduced in 0.8.3.
* Screenshot support is back, using Print Screen (or s on the grading screen.)
* Fix hold arrow + random transform bug.

0.8.3 - Also it should be called Streetball.			[2004.01.04]
!!! Completely new user interface for almost all screens. Please pay
  attention to the help messages displayed onscreen, because many of the
  controls have changed.
  + CD title and advanced BPM display support.
+ 3 panel mode (automatically generated from 6 panel beginner steps in
  .dwi, or available directly in .dance).
+ Hold arrows now have a grace period (by default 1/4 second, but it's
  affected by the judge type and difficulty).
+ Best grades for songs are now stored (in ~/.pydance/records).
+ Arrow animations have been tweaked to make songs with lots of 24th notes
  (like bag) easier to read.
+ Rewrite of findbpm by Paul Crowley to do least-squares estimation.
+ Non-EMSUSB2 adapters work again.

0.8.2 - I"M GONNA EAT YOU!!!1					[2003.11.16]
+ Input keys/buttons can now be remapped in the game.
 + Default keys are the numeric pad for player 1 and uiojklnm, for player 2.
 + Arrow keys, if unmapped, work for player 1 as well.
 ! The 'keyboard' option is gone.
 ! The 'saveinput' option saves an input.cfg file (in . or ~/.pydance) on
   exit. Delete this file to reset your mappings to defaults.
+ Animated arrows in the 'ddresque', 'vividesque', and 'soloesque' themes.
 - This release may be slower, especially for animated arrows.
+ Courses (Oni/Nonstop) support; put the files in ~/.pydance/courses
  courses/ under your pydance installation directory. Currently only
  DWI/SM-style .crs files are supported.
! The 'mrt' announcer theme is now distributed separately from the main source.
! Support for MAD/AO audio output was removed. It didn't work reliably anyway.
* Many crashes and bugs were fixed.

0.8.1 - Standard caution on the Probulator			[2003.09.12]
+ pydance, DDR 1st/2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th/Max2/Ex, Ex Oni, or Ex Nonstop scoring.
+ Regular, DDR Oni, and Pump It Up combo counters.
+ Regular or endless mode grading.
+ Beat-based (old pydance) or time-based (Stepmania-like) judge.
 ! Time-based is the new default judge.
+ Secret arrows added; these cannot be missed (although they can be boo'd),
  but still add (many!) points, combo counts, and so on. These can be turned
  off, not displayed but counted (default), or displayed faintly.
+ "Cycle" arrow fading in addition to sudden/hidden, as well as stealth mode.
+ Other game modes can be autogenerated from 5 panel steps (e.g. KSF files)
* Break and boost look much better now.
* Growing and shrinking hold arrows work.
* For people interested in working on pydance, the start of a HACKING
  file is included with this release, and the source is much cleaner
  and well-documented in many places.
- This release may be slightly slower on some systems; Psyco is recommended.
! pydance no longer loads or renames old pyddr configuration files and
  directories (You've had almost two months to move them).

0.8.0 - That's the second largest ChangeLog I've ever seen!	[2003.08.22]
+ New options:
 + "Wide" to add jumps.
 + Holds on/off.
 + Big (add 8ths), quick (add 16ths), skippy (add gallops).
+ 5 panel (Pump It Up), 9 panel, and parapara support.
 + Support for KSF file for 5 panel steps.
  - BPM changes in KSF files are not supported yet.
 + Support for SM files with 5 panel or PPP steps.
 - Actual PIU pads may or may not work; none were available for testing.
 - The PPP controller will not work.
+ Versus, couple, and double 5, 6, 8, 9 panel, and parapara modes.
+ New game type selector, so you can do e.g. Double/Endless.
+ A document on the KSF file format has been added in docs/.
+ The .dance specification has been updated with new modes and corrections.
+ A new centered display for single player modes.
+ "Tug" lifebar mode where your good steps make your opponents' life go down.
+ New theming code.
 + Load themes from .zip files if possible.
 + Brings back oldschool and bryan themes.
 + New default arrow graphics for all modes by xsdg.
 + DDR-like arrow themes by piman and JZig for 48x48 and 32x32 modes.
 + PIU-like theme for 5 panel mode.
 + Autodetect what game modes a theme will work for.
 - Setting themes is more complicated.
+ Steps are autogenerated for modes that are not available, if the steps
  have SINGLE, DOUBLE, or COUPLE mode defined.
+ A new, fairer, original scoring algorithm; 20% of your score depends on
  your combo lengths, 80% on your ratings. Combos give progressively higher
  scores for longer lengths e.g. a 50 combo is worth about twice as much
  as two 25 combos. Scores always have a maximum of 50,000,000 regardless
  of the song rating.
* Double mirror works correctly.
* Support the Thrustmaster USB mats (probably), and X-Box controllers.
 + We suspect that pydance will run properly on GNU/Linux on an X-Box now.
* Correctly encode/decode KSF, SM, DWI, and .dance file metadata.
 * KSF requires the Python Koco codecs package for CP949 support.
* DWI parsing for braindead constructs like "2!(2".
* No more out of order arrows and "jumping back" on stops.
* Many crashes fixed (stops with holds, oni lifebar selection, an edge-case
  in endless mode with two players).
* Parsing for all files is now more informative and less error-prone.
- Assist mode is broken for non-4 panel modes, we need more sounds.
- any2dance removed, it won't work anymore with this version.
- In-game menu help removed, due to inaccuracies.

0.7.4 - In My Pants						[2003.07.28]
+ 6 panel ("solo") and 8 panel support.
+ Double (1 player, both sides) support.
 - 'totaljudgings' option no longer works (no one was using it anyway...)
* Song selector UI tweaks (faster animations, nicer folder opening).
* Respace the arrows to be closer together in single/versus.
* All 9 directions can always be done on the numeric pad for player 1.
 - azerty 2nd player start key changed to '+' on the numeric pad.
* "Escape" changed from left+start to start+select.
* Some more speed optimizations for slower processors.
* Some DWI parser fixes for bad files.
* 'usepsyco' option (on by default) to try and load the Psyco JIT compiler.
- 'oldschool' and 'bryan' were removed (temporarily, maybe).

0.7.3
* Skipped, because the Linux Game Tome called 0.7.2 0.7.3 by mistake.

0.7.2 -	Dilaudid, how I love thee                               [2003.07.14]
+ Boost, brake, left, right, mirror, shuffle, and random ("supershuffle").
+ "Suck" lifebar mode, you fail if you do too good.
+ "Drop" lifebar mode, goes down at the regular speed but never up.

  + okay, it's the same selector, but it looks loads better
  + has in-songselector help with keys and buttons and what they do
  + proper banner rotation on the larger, newer, higher quality banners
+ ASSIST mode - useful to hear the beats of the arrows
  + different sounds played for different arrows when they should be hit

    + plays 10 second preview of song during song selection
      + use config file option "previewmusic" to toggle on/off

+ LYRICS SUPPORT
  + Oy, the lyrics option has always been there but no code to display em.

    file while playing an mp3 and writes out lyric data for step files
  + lyrics fade out based on how long they are
  + second line of text available for alternate languages
  + now that STEP files are a little more happy, format is in stepfile.txt

+ localised a few font calls to get a little speed increase (less jerky)
+ sudden and hidden arrows are alpha-based fadein/outs
+ added nice little border around lifebar for visibility
+ DWI2STEP is now included
  - it doesn't do much more than MSD2STEP but you don't need to rename DWIs
+ new step inputter: inSTEP - good for inputting steps
  + it's a bit dumb, but has online help. requires bryan theme. 
  + won't overwrite existing STEP files.
* bugfix: arrow effects/explosions on top of arrows again
* bugfix: screenshots work again (hit 's' in the game)

0.5.1 - I can see ASS in my dance				[2002.06.07]
+ the author can finally pass afronova and paranoia in basic mode
+ ddrmat module cleanup (doesn't create kernel taints)
+ pyjoy is a little more verbose in describing what's going on
+ COLORS IN OFFBEAT ARROWS (the most requested feature!)
+ a few minor optimizations ( == better framerates )
+ configuration additions
  + scrollspeed can now be a decimal (floating-point) value
  + option 'grading' in configfile to turn off grading at end of songs
  + option 'explodestyle' - 0 for non-exploding, 1 for rotating only,
    2 for scaling only, 3 for both types of 'arrow explosions'
  + option 'arrowcolors' to decide which arrows get colored - 1 for 
    all-same-color, 2 for offbeats-only, 4 for beat-offbeat-wayoffbeat
  + option 'little' to decide which arrows get DISPLAYED - 1 to turn off 
    16ths, 2 for eighths off, 3 for only quarter notes, 0 to disable
+ debug mode: specify stepfile / mode at runtime and pyddr will play/exit
  (example:    ./pyddr.py 6jan trick    starts 6jan.step in trick mode)
+ now displays total number of combos, and how early/late/ontime player is
+ remembers which song it was on in the song selector again
+ if the music file is bad/doesn't exist, game won't crash anymore
+ at last, pyDDR timing works on mu's machine. New option 'mixerclock' in 
  config file to get song position from SDL_mixer instead of system.

0.5.0 - WHAT?! They done shot the tires on my van!		[2002.05.18]
+ pyDDR now REQUIRES at least Pygame 1.4.9, please install it!

+ music for song selector (stops after 4 loops)
+ music and screen while looking for songs (should not need to loop)
+ recognises when you have no songs and tells you where to get them
+ should not be as dodgy/crashy when only one song is 'installed'
+ new graphics theme 'origddr' for classic looking arrows
+ announcer should work on ALL machines, not just linux boxes with >1 dsp
+ ARROWS EXPLODE (you know, like real DDR) on perfects and greats
+ judging when arrow is stepped on, not half-beat later (thanks Dave!)

0.4.9 - I made it -- you EAT it!
+ fixed incorrect current/bestcombo display in grading screen
+ better/more accurate judging on doubles (now just buggy, not problematic)
+ LONG AWAITED CONFIGURATION FILE SUPPORT (thanks nat!)
  + joystick buttons can be set in pyddr.cfg - pyjoy.py can help find them
  + all new listed features below are configurable from pyddr.cfg
  - not all options specified in the configfile are implemented right now!
+ NEW FEATURES
  + reverse scrolling (arrows scroll top to bottom)
  + 'top' arrow display on/off
  + master offset option incase all songs seem to start at the wrong time
  + onboard audio option incase you have an onboard sound chipset
    (some audio chipsets play 44.1khz sound at 48khz for some reason)
  + autofail ('kill song on fail') optional, off by default
  + configurable arrow speed multiplier (a la pump it up)    
  + adjustable SUDDEN mode (can hide almost all the screen or just a bit)

    (if the announcer breaks your machine, set djtheme to none)
  + will be working on all platforms soon! =]
  - currently has an overlap quirk
+ THEMES!
  + both announcer and graphics theme are themable to at least a degree

0.4.5 - a few new ideas.... more like LOTS of new code
+ MAJOR CODE REWRITE (MANY thanks to Bob, Dave, and Pete for lots of help)
  + lots of class, sprite, and speed improvements - should be ultra-smooth
    + song selector is nice and slick, for example
      + can't select a difficulty that doesn't exist in a step file now
      + up at top and down at bottom wraps to other end of songlist
  + BETTER TIMING (enduser is less likely to have to mess with my offsets) 
    - you WILL need new step files.... sorry!
    + offset should not require tweaking on fast machines
    + top arrows don't only flash, they animate too!
  + judging and combo displays are now in a new style at the bottom
    + "sticky" judging history of last three arrows
    + combo sticks on the screen as long as combo is over 3
    + judging and combo are BEHIND arrows; less distracting
    * if you don't like this, don't worry, it'll be configurable soon

0.4.1 - "rise from your grave!"
+ fixed stupid bug where all of 100+x combo texts was not erased
+ now draws X on both arrows when you miss a double
+ Lifebar improvements
  + more fairness in judgement
  + tells you when you've failed (but doesn't kill song)
  - still don't know how lifebars work =]
+ MSD2STEP fixes 
  + tries to write more accurate start times
  + fixed offsets to something that seems to be more common

0.4.0 - the "oops, I forgot to release 0.3.5" release
+ NEW DEMO SONG COMES WITH PYDDR
  + I even wrote it!
  + multiple difficulty levels (BASIC and TRICK)
+ Caches MP3 before playing it - this should make seeking faster and 
  resolve the "sometimes the timing is off but not always" issues
  - will probably need to download new step files or tweak the old ones
+ improved song selector
  + looks a lot better (embossed text etc)
  + not as buggy (doesn't crash unless you have bad STEP files)
  + has DIFFICULTY SELECTOR/display in the corner (oo pretty, use L and R)
+ improved lifebar (sort of)
  + lifebar doesn't go way past 0 or way above 50 now =]
  + I need feedback:
    should the lifebar reflect the kind of grade you're getting instead?
+ improved MSD2STEP
  + generates files that won't crash pyDDR =]
  + supports multiple difficulties in MSD files
  + seems to be working better on MSD files for the time being

0.3.5 - "Give it your best!"
+ added SONG SELECTOR: just run pyddr.py now
  + automatically reads in STEP files, song/group/bpm, displays nicely
  + smooth scrolling that is restricted to the step files available
  + is integrated into pyddr now and looks pretty damn good
  - song selector is buggy on dev machine, if I change focus while it's 
    running, X stalls for like 30 seconds (anyone know what's going on?)
+ joystick code shouldn't break execution on boxes with no joysticks
+ pyDDR runs on OSX! Thanks, Bob!
+ SELECT on ddr mat will switch back/forth from/to fullscreen
+ START on ddr mat will exit song/scoring screen and start songs

0.3.2 - home improvement
+ grading improved (now percentage based and slightly more leanient)
  + percentages are displayed as well, and rounded to nearest tenth
+ pulsing stationary arrows now auto-adjust to framerate
+ fixed stepped-but-didn't-get-judging bug
+ lines in stepfiles can be commented with #
+ rudimentary LIFE BAR!
  + does anyone know the technicalities of how DDR's lifebar works? =]
+ rearranged the goals list a little bit - I want a song selector now.
+ animated startup with songs and stuff, kinda cool
+ ddr mat module included with pyddr with hacks for the arrows to work

0.3.1 - more beauty
+ GRAPHICAL GRADING
+ can now use numpad arrows as well as normal arrows
+ fixed dumb joystick bug I think

0.3.0 - feelin mighty fine, oh yeah
+ NEW BEAUTIFUL IMAGES FOR THE ARROWS (thanks, Bryan!)
  + decided this will be themable in the future
  + can define graphics theme by changing a theme= line in the source
    + this also cleans up the main pyddr directory as well
+ GRADING (SSS/SS/S/A/B/C/D/E)
  - I /still/ don't know how DDR grading works but this seems to be decent
+ by the way, you can take screenshots: 's' and switch to fullscreen: 'f'
+ fps counter moved to lower left of playfield

0.2.5 - decent progress
+ supports ddr mats
  + will not initialise joystick if no joystick is found
  - joystick code makes pyddr SLOOOOW
  - detection of DDR mat is rudimentary; finds a 6 axis, 12 button joystick
  - have to turn the mat 45 degrees counterclockwise and dance on buttons
+ fixed bug where combos wouldn't break
+ step file improvements
  + supports startat marker: will skip X seconds into song and start there
  + supports endat marker: will stop at X seconds after song is playing
  + supports song and group markers: displays them at top of screen
+ antialiased fonts
  - colors are wrong when antialiasing is on, oh well
  + this is a result of a bug in SDL_ttf, upgrading to 2.0.4 fixes it!
+ based step judging on time-since-step, not frames, looks much cleaner
  + also, for example, "CRAPPY" stays onscreen as long as "PERFECT" now
+ draws an X on a missed step once you've completely blown it

0.2.0 - "oh, screw the roadmap" release
+ fixed .step extension adder. I'm just stupid.
+ smoothed out arrow animations even more. please report if you like it.
+ step judging improved:
  + can no longer step twice in [very quick] succession to improve judging
  + tells you how many perfect/great/etc.'s you have upon exit
  + COMBOS (in playfield!)
  + misses
- still judges up+down, left+right, etc, as seperates (count as 2)
  + but it WILL give you a miss if you miss one of them 
  ? should I leave it this way, or make judging as a pair? Mixed opinions.
- I don't know how the real DDR grading works, I am only good at guessing
+ fixed some delay things. eventually I will base this on time, not frames
+ changed INSTALL to explain adding songs

0.1.9 - pretty! well, ok, not really.
+ now displays step judgement onscreen instead of in console
+ cleaned up codebase a little bit. eliminated beat-o-meter
+ repaired MSD2STEP - was writing garbage step files for some reason
  + writes filenames in lowercase
  + supports 16th notes in MSD files

0.1.5 - help is on the way
+ does not require you to specify .step extension - it'll add it on
+ preliminary MSD to STEP conversion utility
  - I don't know exactly how GAP works (docs are rather unclear)
  - steps usually need fine tuning
  - STEP files are not "compressed" very well
  - you still need to convert WAV files to MP3 yourself

0.1.4 - mo' features mo' problems? no mo, yo mofo. yo.
+ pyddr actually exits when song is over instead of requiring ESC
+ timing code is less anal (OK and GREAT before step is registered)
+ step arrows now cross over the pulsing ones at the right time (sorry)
+ step arrows twice as smooth (not slick as a baby's bottom, though)
+ more configfile support (no more hacking code to play different songs):
  + now gets STEP file from commandline (test.step if not specified)
  + reads in mp3 file to play from step file

0.1.3 - more time (timing?) on my hands
+ version update to .step files
+ bpm / ticks / beats are all floating-point, therefore more accurate
  (yeah, I know, I should have done this in the beginning, but....)
+ new keywords for .step files to save filespace and fingers:
  + eight (eighth note)  - does "skip 1 tick after this step"
  + qurtr (quarter note) - does "skip 3 ticks after this step"
  + halfn (half note)    - does "skip 7 ticks after this step"

0.1.2 - coloring
+ got bored, colored in the arrows that scroll =]
+ fixed a few very stupid typos that improve judging steps

0.1.1 - timing code update
+ arrows scroll more smoothly/accurately
+ step judging is based on fractions of beats rather than milliseconds
+ tightened timing code to stay on beat again

0.1.0 - I feel leet so this version gets a major number increase
+ IT SCROLLS ARROWS!
  
0.0.4 - file handling begins to show up
+ loads in step files:
  + implements STEPS
  + understands DELAY
    + implements it too
  + understands READY
    - ignores it
  + understands STEPS
    + can display them on the beat they're supposed to hit to console
  + judges step accuracy - BUGGY

0.0.3 - freshmeat preparedness release
+ actually worked up a real ChangeLog, README, LICENSE, and webpage

0.0.2 - another yay-but-not-really release
+ input handler actually does something useful, like make the arrows on 
  the screen flash!
+ little BEAT-o-meter at the bottom of the screen. kind of neat. this is 
  for those that don't realise the arrows pulse to the beat, too.
+ tells you what beat it's on

0.0.1 - the only inital release worth giving a version number
+ successfully flashes to the bpm specified in the source
+ input handler but the only key that does anything is ESC =]
